# Forecasting-Air-Quality

The main goal of this project is to forescast the air quality in terms of meteorological data such as the wind speed, wind direction, height above the ground level, visiblity, air temperature, dew point, atmosphere pressure and relative humidity. For that we will use different statistical and machine learning tools.
